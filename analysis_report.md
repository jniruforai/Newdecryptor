# Code Analysis Report: Decrypt.exe and Python Dependencies

## Executive Summary

I have successfully analyzed both the `decrypt.exe` executable and the compiled Python code package (`new.zip`). This appears to be a ransomware decryption tool designed to reverse the encryption process performed by malware with the identifier "sil3ncer".

## Key Findings

### 1. decrypt.exe Analysis

**File Type:** PyInstaller-compiled Python executable
- **Size:** 13,248,139 bytes (~13 MB)
- **Python Version:** 3.8
- **PyInstaller Version:** 2.1+
- **Platform:** Windows (x64)

### 2. Main Functionality (decrypt.py)

The decompiled source code reveals a ransomware decryption tool with the following capabilities:

#### Core Components:
1. **FileScanner Class**: Scans all logical drives for encrypted files
2. **Decryptor Class**: Inherits from FileScanner, performs file decryption

#### Critical Information Found:
- **Secret Key (Base64):** `SXpbALf2gHKTD9oIZbSUag==`
- **Unique ID:** `Z71UARTPV4WH`
- **File Extension Pattern:** `.Z71UARTPV4WH.sil3ncer`

#### Encryption Details:
- **Algorithm:** AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- **Mode:** CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)
- **Key Size:** 128-bit (derived from base64 decoded key)
- **Chunk Size:** 65,536 bytes (64KB)
- **IV Storage:** First 16 bytes of encrypted file
- **File Size Storage:** First 16 bytes contain original file size

### 3. Operational Flow

1. **Drive Scanning:** Uses `win32api.GetLogicalDriveStrings()` to enumerate all drives
2. **File Detection:** Searches for files ending with `.Z71UARTPV4WH.sil3ncer`
3. **Decryption Process:**
   - Reads original file size (first 16 bytes)
   - Extracts IV (next 16 bytes)
   - Creates AES-CBC decryptor with secret key and IV
   - Decrypts file in 64KB chunks
   - Truncates to original file size
   - Removes encrypted file after successful decryption
4. **Multi-processing:** Uses all available CPU cores for parallel processing

### 4. Dependencies Analysis (new.zip)

The package contains comprehensive Python runtime and cryptographic libraries:

#### Cryptographic Libraries:
- **PyCrypto/PyCryptodome:** Complete cryptographic suite
  - AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish, CAST, ARC2, ARC4
  - ChaCha20, Salsa20 stream ciphers
  - Various cipher modes (ECB, CBC, CFB, CTR)

#### Windows-Specific Libraries:
- **win32api:** Windows API access
- **win32com:** COM interface support
- **pywin32:** Windows-specific functionality

#### Standard Libraries:
- Complete Python 3.8 standard library
- multiprocessing, os, base64 modules

### 5. Security Assessment

#### Potential Concerns:
1. **Ransomware Decryption Tool:** This is clearly designed to decrypt files encrypted by ransomware
2. **Hard-coded Credentials:** Secret key and unique ID are embedded in the code
3. **Drive-wide Scanning:** Scans entire system for encrypted files
4. **File Deletion:** Removes encrypted files after decryption (could be dangerous if decryption fails)

#### Technical Quality:
1. **Error Handling:** Basic exception handling present but limited
2. **Performance:** Uses multiprocessing for efficient decryption
3. **File Safety:** Attempts to preserve original file size through truncation

### 6. Reverse Engineering Insights

#### Ransomware Characteristics:
- **Family Name:** "sil3ncer" (based on file extension)
- **Unique Campaign ID:** Z71UARTPV4WH (likely victim/campaign specific)
- **Encryption Strength:** AES-128 CBC (cryptographically strong)
- **File Structure:** Preserves original file size metadata

#### Recovery Key:
The base64-encoded key `SXpbALf2gHKTD9oIZbSUag==` decodes to:
```
Raw Key (hex): 49 7a 5b 00 b7 f6 80 72 93 0f da 08 65 b4 94 6a
```

## Recommendations

### For Legitimate Use:
1. **Backup Verification:** Ensure file backups exist before running decryption
2. **Test Environment:** Run on isolated test files first
3. **Progress Monitoring:** Monitor decryption progress carefully

### For Security Analysis:
1. **IOCs (Indicators of Compromise):**
   - File extension: `.Z71UARTPV4WH.sil3ncer`
   - Registry entries or persistence mechanisms (not visible in this code)
   - Network communications (not present in this decryptor)

2. **Attribution:**
   - Unique ID suggests this is victim-specific
   - Could be part of ransom payment process

### For Digital Forensics:
1. **Evidence Preservation:** Original encrypted files are deleted after decryption
2. **Timeline Analysis:** File modification times will change during decryption
3. **Key Material:** Recovery key is available for forensic analysis

## Conclusion

This is a professional-grade ransomware decryption tool built with Python and compiled using PyInstaller. The code demonstrates sophisticated understanding of cryptographic operations and Windows system APIs. The presence of hard-coded decryption keys suggests this tool was either:

1. Provided by the ransomware operators as part of payment process
2. Created by security researchers who obtained the decryption keys
3. Developed by law enforcement or incident response teams

The cryptographic implementation appears sound, using industry-standard AES encryption with proper IV handling and file size preservation.
