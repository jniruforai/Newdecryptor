The AI engineer was initially tasked with analyzing an existing Decryptor exe and associated compiled Python code. The core problem was to understand its functionality, especially given its reported instability (crashing, scanning all disks). The AI successfully identified the  as a PyInstaller-packaged Python application, extracted its components, and decompiled the main  file to reveal the underlying Python source.

Upon user feedback about the original tool's flaws, the AI pivoted to developing two new, improved Python-based decryption scripts:  for quick use, and  for advanced, robust recovery. These new tools address the user's explicit need for targeted decryption, crash resistance, and better resource management. The AI then demonstrated the efficacy of these new tools by successfully decrypting a user-provided encrypted PDF file.

The current challenge involves delivering the decrypted binary file to the user, which the AI is addressing by providing the file's base64 encoded content in chunks, along with various decoding instructions. This systematic approach—analysis, problem-solving through new development, testing, and delivery—reflects a comprehensive engineering workflow.

<product_requirements>
The user initially required an analysis of a provided Decryptor exe and associated compiled Python code to understand its functionality. The implicit problem was the instability and indiscriminate nature of the existing tool.
Following the initial analysis, the user explicitly requested an improved decryption tool with the following requirements:
1.  **Targeted Decryption**: The new decryptor must target specific folders only, avoiding system-wide disk scanning.
2.  **Stability**: The tool should be stable and not crash frequently, addressing issues observed with the original .
3.  **Step-by-step Recovery**: The new tool should enable a more controlled, step-by-step recovery process.
4.  **Executable Output**: The user desired a new decryptor  (implicitly for Windows, later clarified by the AI).
5.  **Functionality Verification**: Decrypt a specific user-provided encrypted file () using the newly created program and share the decrypted output for verification.
6.  **File Accessibility**: Make the decrypted file () available for download.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **PyInstaller**: Tool for packaging Python applications into standalone executables.
- **Python Bytecode Decompilation**: Process of converting  files back to readable Python source code using tools like .
- ****: A utility used for extracting contents from PyInstaller-generated executables.
- **AES-128 CBC**: The symmetric encryption algorithm identified as used by the original ransomware (via PyCrypto/PyCryptodome).
- ****: Python library for cryptographic operations, utilized in the new decryption tools.
- **Base64 Encoding**: Method used to represent binary data in an ASCII string format for transfer.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has successfully analyzed the provided Decryptor exe and compiled Python code. It identified the  as a PyInstaller-bundled Python application and managed to decompile the main  file into , providing insights into the original decryption mechanism (AES-128 CBC, key, IV).

Addressing the user's concern about the original tool's instability and system-wide scanning, the AI developed two new Python-based decryption scripts:
1.  ****: A streamlined version for quick, targeted decryption.
2.  ****: A more robust version featuring logging, progress tracking, resume capabilities, and configurable workers for comprehensive recovery.
These scripts were built with  and designed to target specific folders, eliminating the system-wide scan issue.

The AI then successfully demonstrated the functionality by decrypting a user-provided encrypted PDF file () into . This decrypted file was verified to be a valid PDF document.

Currently, the immediate task is to enable the user to download the decrypted . Since direct file download is not supported in the environment, the AI is providing the file's content base64 encoded. It has split the large base64 string into several chunks and has provided the first three chunks to the user, with the remaining chunks pending delivery.
