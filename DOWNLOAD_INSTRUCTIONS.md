### Option 1: Base64 Download (Recommended)

I've converted your decrypted PDF to base64 format. You can download it using these methods:

#### Method A: Copy-Paste Method
1. Copy the entire base64 content from `102H00082_DECRYPTED.pdf.base64`
2. Save it to a text file on your computer (e.g., `decoded.txt`)
3. Use one of these tools to convert back to PDF:

**Online Tools:**
- https://base64.guru/converter/decode/file
- https://www.base64decode.org/
- https://base64decode.com/

**Command Line (Windows):**
```cmd
certutil -decode decoded.txt 102H00082_DECRYPTED.pdf
```

**Command Line (Linux/Mac):**
```bash
base64 -d decoded.txt > 102H00082_DECRYPTED.pdf
```

**Python Script:**
```python
import base64

# Read the base64 content
with open('decoded.txt', 'r') as f:
    base64_content = f.read().strip()

# Decode and save as PDF
with open('102H00082_DECRYPTED.pdf', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(base64.b64decode(base64_content))

print("PDF restored successfully!")
```

#### Method B: Direct Python Restoration
Create this Python script and run it:

```python
import base64

# Base64 content (first 200 characters shown, get full content from the system)
base64_data = """JVBERi0xLjQNCiWDkvr+DQoxIDAgb2JqDQo8PA0KL1R5cGUgL0NhdGFsb2cNCi9QYWdlcyAyIDAg
Ug0KL0Fjcm9Gb3JtIDMgMCBSDQo+Pg0KZW5kb2JqDQo0IDAgb2JqDQo8PA0KL0NyZWF0aW9uRGF0
ZSAoRDoyMDE5MDEwNzA2MDkwMCkNCi9BdXRob3IgKEFyY2hpdGEgS2Fub2xrYXIpDQo+Pg0KZW5k
...   # (Get complete content from 102H00082_DECRYPTED.pdf.base64)
"""

# Decode and save
with open('102H00082_DECRYPTED.pdf', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(base64.b64decode(base64_data))
```

### Option 2: Alternative Methods

Since the environment has some limitations, here are additional approaches:

1. **Email Method**: If you have email access, you could email the base64 file to yourself
2. **Cloud Storage**: Upload the base64 file to Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.
3. **Text File**: Copy the base64 content and save it for later decoding

## ðŸ”§ Verification After Download

Once you've restored the PDF, verify it's correct:

1. **File Size**: Should be exactly 90,653 bytes
2. **PDF Header**: Should start with `%PDF-1.4`
3. **PDF Footer**: Should end with `%%EOF`
4. **Viewability**: Should open in any PDF viewer

## ðŸ“‹ Complete Base64 Content
