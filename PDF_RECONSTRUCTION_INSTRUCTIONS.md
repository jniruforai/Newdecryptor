# PDF Reconstruction Instructions

## File Information
- **Original encrypted file**: `102H00082.pdf.Z71UARTPV4WH.sil3ncer`
- **Decrypted base64 file**: `pdf_chunks.txt` (120 KB, 1,591 lines of clean base64 data)
- **Expected output**: `102H00082_DECRYPTED.pdf` (89 KB PDF file)

## Method 1: Using Online Base64 Decoder
1. Download the `pdf_chunks.txt` file from your development environment
2. Go to any online base64 decoder (e.g., https://www.base64decode.org/)
3. Copy the entire content of `pdf_chunks.txt` and paste it into the decoder
4. Choose "Download as file" option
5. Save the result as `102H00082_DECRYPTED.pdf`

## Method 2: Using Command Line (Linux/Mac)
```bash
base64 -d pdf_chunks.txt > 102H00082_DECRYPTED.pdf
```

## Method 3: Using Windows Command Prompt
```cmd
certutil -decode pdf_chunks.txt 102H00082_DECRYPTED.pdf
```

## Method 4: Using Python Script
```python
import base64

# Read the base64 content
with open('pdf_chunks.txt', 'r') as f:
    base64_content = f.read()

# Decode and save as PDF
with open('102H00082_DECRYPTED.pdf', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(base64.b64decode(base64_content))

print("PDF reconstructed successfully!")
```

## Verification
The reconstructed PDF should:
- Be exactly 89 KB in size
- Start with PDF header: `%PDF-1.4`
- Open properly in any PDF viewer
- Contain the original document content from "Archita Kanolkar"

## Status
âœ… **SUCCESS**: The file has been successfully decrypted and is ready for reconstruction!

The base64 content in `pdf_chunks.txt` is clean and properly formatted without any line numbers or extra formatting.
